![Cosmic Coder Portfolio](https://placehold.co/1200x600/0B0C10/66FCF1?text=Sipo%27s%20Portfolio)

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It was built from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a software engineer. The site is fully responsive and features a custom "Cosmic Coder" theme.
